				<h3>First Steps</h3>
				<p>This process is what I went through when creating my own Etsy shop. When you begin with your Etsy shop, It’ll ask for your shop preferences such as the language your shop will be in, the shop country, and the currency that will be used for the online transaction. The next step would be to name your shop. When you type your name into the box and it will check for availability. If the name you have chosen is available then you will continue.</p>

				<h3>Stocking</h3>
				<p>The next steps will be to add the listings to your shop. You’ll be asked to take pictures of the item or items that you are selling. This can be a physical product or a digital one. When creating my Etsy shop I was selling digital products. You are asked to give it a title and information about the listings. You’ll then have to put the product into a type of category and give it a description. Lastly, you’ll have to put information on inventory and pricing. If it’s a digital file then you have to put the digital item asleep so the buyers can access it when the item is purchased.</p>

				<h3>How You'll Get Paid</h3>
				<p>Then you’ll need to add information on banking so that when an item is purchased the money will be sent to the bank. First, they’ll ask where is your bank located and the money that is used in your country will be sent accordingly. They’ll ask information on where the funds will be deposited but there is no need to worry because your information is protected using SSL encryption and security. They’ll ask information about yourself Country of residence, name, age, social security number, and address.</p>
